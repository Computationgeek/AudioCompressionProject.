AudioCompressionProject.

A MATLAB mini project for audio signal compression and decompression using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)


Description

The project involves:
- Reading an audio file.
- Compressing the audio signal using DCT.
- Decompressing the audio signal.
- Calculating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
- Plotting the original, compressed, and decompressed signals.
- Playing the original, compressed, and decompressed audio.

Files

- `audio_compression.m`: MATLAB script for the audio compression project.
- `Add Your Audio.wav`: Input audio file (not included in the repository due to file size).


Outputs

- Plots of the original, compressed, and decompressed audio signals.
- SNR value displayed in the MATLAB console.
- Audio playback of the original, compressed, and decompressed signals.
